## Installation
Smartface Barcode Extension can be installed via npm easily from our public npm repository. The installation is pretty easy via Smartface Cloud IDE.
- Open scripts/package.json file inside your workspace.
- Add Barcode extension dependency as:`"sf-extension-barcode": "^1.0.0"`
- Run command `npm install` under the folder `scripts`
- Finally require the extension as: `require("sf-extension-barcode")`
## How to use
1) Require extension with `require("sf-extension-barcode").BarcodeScanner`
2) Create an instance of `BarcodeScanner` via below example. The scanning page is a fullscreen page.
```javascript
var barcodeScanner = new BarcodeScanner();
```
3) You can customize scanning page using `barcodeScanner.layout`. Look at sample code in `sample` folder for details.
```javascript
barcodeScanner.layout.addChild(view);
```
4) Set `onResult` callback to handle the result: 
```javascript
barcodeScanner.onResult = function(e) {
    var barcode = e.barcode;
}
```
5) Finally call `show` method with required parameters to scan barcode. Don't forget to guarantee camera [permission](#permissions) `show` method.
```javascript
barcodeScanner.show({page: pageInstance, tag: "myPageTag"});
```
